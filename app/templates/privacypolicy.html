    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

    <p>
      SpecDrift (“we”, “our”, “us”) respects your privacy.
      This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how it is used,
      and how it is protected when you use the SpecDrift website and services.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      SpecDrift is an API contract comparison tool designed for developers.
      Our guiding principle is simple:
    </p>
    <p><strong>We do not collect or store your API specifications or personal data unless absolutely necessary.</strong></p>

    <h2>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>User accounts or authentication data</li>
      <li>Uploaded OpenAPI specifications</li>
      <li>Stored comparison results</li>
      <li>Personal identifiers</li>
      <li>User tracking across sessions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Uploaded files are processed <strong>in memory only</strong> and discarded immediately
      after the comparison is completed.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Information We May Collect</h2>

    <h3>a. Technical & Usage Data</h3>
    <p>
      We may collect limited, anonymous technical information such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Browser type</li>
      <li>Operating system</li>
      <li>Pages visited</li>
      <li>General usage statistics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This data is used solely to improve performance, understand usage patterns,
      and maintain service reliability.
      It cannot be used to personally identify you.
    </p>

    <h3>b. Server Logs</h3>
    <p>
      Server logs may temporarily record request metadata such as timestamps,
      HTTP status codes, and error messages.
      These logs do <strong>not</strong> include uploaded API specifications and are
      periodically rotated or deleted.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      SpecDrift does not use tracking cookies.
      If analytics are enabled, they are privacy-focused, cookie-less,
      and used only for aggregated metrics.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      We may use third-party infrastructure providers (such as hosting or analytics services)
      strictly to operate the platform.
      These providers do not receive your uploaded API specifications and are required
      to adhere to appropriate data protection practices.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect the service,
      including in-memory processing and secure server configurations.
      However, no method of transmission over the internet is completely secure.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      SpecDrift is intended for developers and professionals.
      We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
      Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
    </p>
